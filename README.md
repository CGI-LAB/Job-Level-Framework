# Job-Level-Framework

This project is simple version for demonstrating the JL framework which is mentioned in paper "Software Development Architecture for Job-Level Algorithms"

### Note:
1. This project need to build with libCGCG (a.k.a. link with libCGDG.a), otherwise it doesn't work.
2. We can provide the current version with CUI (use MFC) through mail if needed.
